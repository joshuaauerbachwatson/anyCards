		<a name="What">What is AnyCards?</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		<em>AnyCards</em> provides a virtual cardtable surface that is shared across
		devices, and a virtual deck of cards.  It allows you to move and turn over cards,
        make boxes to hold stacks of cards, and do routine moves like dealing or
        taking up a hand.
	</p>

	<p>The players use their separate devices to play a card game with
		the cards. Each player may optionally have a private hand. The game
		provides for an orderly succession of turns but does not otherwise
		build in the rules of any particular card game. It will support the
		playing of a wide variety of games that are played entirely with
		cards.</p>

	<p>Achieving agreement about what game to play, enforcing its
		rules, or incorporating interactions such as bidding, may require
		voice or message contact between players (not provided by the game).</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Assembling" />How to Connect Players
	</h2>

    <p>
        AnyCards does not provide any "social" features.  Rather, players need to arrange
        in advance to play together.
        These instructions assume you have already identified the players who will play together
        and now want to connect them to each other.  Each such player must have installed AnyCards
        on a device.

	<p>
		After installing and starting the game, touch the <b>Players</b>
		button to bring up a dialog that looks like the picture. <img
			alt="initial players dialog" src="./playerDialogInitial.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		The first time you do this, <b>Your User Name</b> will be whatever
		name you gave to your device (usually not too meaningful to others).
		Touch the white text box to bring up the keyboard and replace the name
		with a name that you want to be known by when playing. Players who
		will play together should choose distinct names.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Exactly one player in the group of players must be the leader.  That player will actually set up the
		game (deal out the cards, do whatever else is required).  The leader also sets the number of players
		that are expected. Touch the blue text to the right of the <b>Are you leader?</b> label to
		toggle back and forth between being the leader and not.  Notice that the <b>Number of players</b>
		stepper appears and disappears accordingly, as does the <b>Setup Game</b> button at the top of
		the app window (not shown in the picture).
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		Decide who in your group will be the leader.  That player should select <b>Yes</b> and the others should select <b>No</b>.
        The player who is leader should then set the number of players.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		There are two ways for players to connect to each other (the <b>Players source</b>), called <b>Nearby
			only</b> and <b>Entire internet</b>. One of these modes is shown in blue.
		Touching the blue text toggles between the two modes.  All players must select the same mode.
	</p>

	<h3>Nearby Only Mode</h3>

	<p>
		In the <b>Nearby only</b> mode, players must be near each other
		(within bluetooth range or on the same wifi hub). All such players are
		assumed to be playing with each other. Once all players have set the <b>Nearby
		only</b> mode, and a single player has assumed the leader role and set the number
		of players, all players may then touch the <b>Find Players</b> button to move on
		to actual play.
	</p>

	<h3>Entire Internet Mode</h3>

	<p>
		When you switch to <b>Entire Internet</b> mode, the players can be
		anywhere, as long as they each have an internet connection active on
        their device. An additional <b>Token</b> field (and sometimes additional buttons) will appear as
        in the picture. <img
            alt="entire internet mode" src="./playerDialogInternet.png">
		All players must touch the token field and then fill it in using the same value.
		Once this is true, all players can touch <b>Find Players</b> and move on to actual play.
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li>The <em>token</em> is a value chosen by a group of players to distinguish
            if from other groups of players.  It should be hard to guess, so that no other AnyCards players can
            crash your game and groups of players don't collide with each other.</li>
		<li>The game token must be made up of letters and numbers only.  Upper and lower
		case letters are distinct (case is meaningful).</li>
        <li>The token must be exactly 12 characters long.  The entry field will stop accepting new characters when 12
            have been entered.  If there are too few, there will be an error popup when you exit text entry or press the
        <b>Find Players</b> button.</li>
        </li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Remembering and retrieving tokens</h4>
	<p>
		Since it takes some effort for a group to come up with a token and for all players to enter it,
		AnyCards provides the ability to remember tokens.  A remembered token can have a "nickname" to help you remember
        its purpose.
        <img alt="remember token dialog" src="./rememberTokenDialog.png">
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When a valid and complete token has been entered, an
			additional <b>Remember this Token</b> button will appear. If you
			touch this button, you will get a confirmation dialog that looks like
			the picture. Touch <b>Confirm</b> to remember the token.  If you wish, you can
			first enter text in the optional "nickname" field.  This will associate a nickname
			to remind you of the purpose of the token. You can remember multiple tokens.
		</li>
		<li>If you have any remembered tokens, one of them will appear in
			the <b>Token</b> field the next time you open the <b>Players</b>
			dialog. There will also be another button labelled <b>Use saved
				token</b>. Touching this button will bring up a selection list from
			which you can select any of your saved tokens. You can also delete
			saved tokens from this selection list by sliding the selection left
			to reveal a delete button.
		</li>
		<li>When tokens have assigned nicknames, they appear in the <b>Token</b>
			field (and in the selection list for using saved tokens) with the
			nickname before the token, separated by a colon (e.g. <b>Bilbo:
				Bilbobaggins</b>). Only the token is shared with other players, however.
			The nickname is just for your private use and is always optional.
		</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>
        <a name="Basics">Card Manipulation Basics</a>
    </h2>
    <img alt="cards and boxes examples" src="./cardsAndBoxes.png">
	<p>
		To familiarize yourself with how to move cards and use boxes, it is
		helpful to go to the <b>Players</b> dialog, set yourself as leader,
		and set the number of players to 1 ("solitaire mode"). Then you can
		experiment with the features discussed here.
	</p>
	<p>The illustration shows examples of cards (both face up and face
		down) and boxes which contain cards. As you work through the details
		of this section, you should eventually be able to reproduce the
		illustration pretty closely (suits and denominations will differ
		because cards are always shuffled randomly).</p>
	<p>Some Details follow.
	
	<h3>Turning cards over</h3>
	<p>Tapping a card that is not covered by other cards will cause it
		to turn over, unless the card is the top card of a deck or discard
		box. For those specical cases, tapping the top card simply "dislodges"
		it from the box, allowing it to turned over with a second tap or moved
		away.</p>
	<h3>Bringing cards to the front</h3>
	<p>Tapping a card that is partly covered by other cards will bring
		the card to the front so that it is no longer covered. After that it
		can be tapped again to turn it over or it can be dragged by itself. A
		card that is completely covered by other cards (so that it cannot be
		tapped) remains covered until the covering cards are removed.</p>
	<h3>Dragging cards</h3>
	<p>Cards may be dragged around the table-top view as part of play.
		If a card is not covered by any other card, it will be dragged by
		itself. If a card is partly covered by other cards, the cards covering
		the dragged card are dragged with it. In addition, cards that cover
		any other card being dragged will also be dragged. So, in the
		illustration, if you drag the nine of diamonds, the king and seven of
		diamonds move with it. If you drag the king, the seven will move with
		it but the nine will not. By first tapping either of the partly
		covered cards you change the relationship, of course. So, if you first
		tap the nine to bring it to the front, and then drag it, it will move
		by itself.</p>

	<h3>Boxes</h3>

	<p>Boxes hold cards. They also have a "legend" containing an
		optional name label, an access-style indicator (up and/or down arrows),
		and a number (in red) indicating how many cards the box is currently
		holding.  The access-style indicator is explained below.</p>

	<p>Cards are added by dragging them until they partially overlap
		the box, at which point they "snap in." Boxes can be moved (their
		cards move with them). To move a box, grab it in the legend area
		(grabbing the card area is interpreted as grabbing the top card).</p>

	<p>
		The leader's initial view of a game, prior to setup, always includes a
		box called "Deck" with all the cards of the playing deck in it. Other
		boxes are produced by <em>dealing</em> and by requesting creation of a
		box (see below).
	</p>

	<h4>Box access styles</h4>

	<p>The access-style indicator consists of an arrow pointing toward the
		cards, an arrow pointing away from the cards, or both. Roughly, these
		indicate that you would mostly be adding cards, mostly removing cards,
		or both. But, the rules are a little more complex, with the purpose of
		avoiding common playing errors.</p>

	<p>
		A box with just the "away" pointing arrow is called a <em>Deck</em>.
		It may contain only face down cards. Cards may not be added to it. The
		top card cannot be turned over in place but it can be moved entirely
		or partially off the box, after which it becomes an ordinary card. The
		deck box in the illustration happens to have the name "Deck", too,
		but, in general, a box's name is distinct from its access-style.
	</p>

	<p>
		A box with just the "toward" pointing arrow is called a <em>Discard</em>
		box. It may contain only face-up cards. Cards may be added by dragging
		them onto the box (and will automatically turn face up). The top card
		may also be dragged off (but not turned over in place). In most games,
		removing a card from a discard box is an unusual move but it isn't
		forbidden.
	</p>

	<p>
		The presence of both arrows indicates a <em>General</em> box. It may
		contain both face up and face down cards. If face up cards are added
		they go to the top of the pile and remain face up. If face down cards
		are added they go to the bottom and remain face down.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Box ownership</h4>

	<p>In some games, after a deal, there may be a box for each player.
		A common error in such games is drawing or turning over a card from
		the wrong box. To avoid these errors, a box may be owned by a specific
		player. Only that player may add or remove cards, turn over the top
		card, or change the box's characteristics. Boxes become owned as a
		result of dealing (this feature can be turned off in the dealing
		dialog), at creation time (in which case they are owned by the
		creator), or in the box modification dialog.</p>
		
	<h4>Creating and modifying boxes</h4>
    <img alt="box modify dialog" src="./boxModifyDialog.png">

	<p>You can create a box using a long press in an area where there
		is room for the box. There will usually be room unless there are
		multiple other boxes nearby. Only other boxes can interfere with box
		creation; if there are cards overlapping the new box they are
		immediately "snapped" up into the box.</p>

	<p>Before actualy creating the box, you will be presented with a
		dialog that looks like the picture. You can set the access style (or
		"kind of box") to "General", "Deck", or "Discard". You can also
		specify the name of the box, and indicate whether you want to own the
		box.</p>

	<img alt="box menu dialog" src="./boxMenu.png">
	<p>Once a box is created (unless it is owned by another player),
		you can access special actions for it by tapping in the legend. A long
		press on the cards will also bring up the dialog. The result will look
		something like the nearby picture. Not all of the buttons in the
		picture will necessarily appear, depending on the state of the box and
		of the game.</p>

	<p>The <b>Take Hand</b> action only appears if the game has been set up with a private
	hand area.  The result is to move all the cards of the box into the private hand area and
	delete the box.  This action is typically performed by each player after a deal in a game that
	has private hands.</p>
	
	<p>The <b>Turn Over</b> action applies only to "Deck" and "Discard" boxes.  It changes the former
	into the latter (and vice versa) while reversing the order of the cards, exactly as if you turned
	the pile of cards over in its entirety.</p>
	
	<p>The <b>Shuffle</b> action randomizes the order of cards in the box without changing anything else
	about it.  Note that the initial "Deck" box at the start of a game is already shuffled.  But, shuffling
	may be appropriate at other times.</p>
	
	<img alt="dealing dialog" src="./dealingDialog.png">
	
	<p>
		The <b>Deal</b> action produces new boxes from some or all of the
		contents of an existing one. The details of the deal are guided by a
		secondary dialog as shown in the picture.  The <b>Deal</b> action is not
		offered if the area where cards are normally dealt contains any cards or boxes.
		This area will always be empty at the start of the setup phase of a game.  The
		area is at the bottom of playing area (above the private hand area if there is one)
		and occupies the width of the screen for the height necessary fit boxes.</p>

	<p>Use the
		first stepper to set the number of hands and the second one to set the size of each hand.
		The <b>Owned</b> indicator defaults to <b>Yes</b> but you can set it to <b>No</b> if 
		you do not want the resulting hands (which are in the form of boxes) to be owned by individual
		players.</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Modify</b> action brings up the dialog shown earlier for box
		creation. it allows you to change a box's name, access style, or <b>Owned</b>
		indicator. But, note that you will not be able to get to this point if
		the box is owned by a player other than you. So, in practice this
		allows you give up ownership if you own the box, or to take ownership
		of an unowned box.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Delete</b> action deletes a box. Note that this does not delete
		the cards that are in the box. They are left in place in an ordinary
		"pile" from which they can then be moved in accordance with the
		general rules for cards. To undo this action, a long press on the pile
		of cards will bring up the box creation dialog and cause the cards
		left in the pile to belong to the new box (a newly created box always
		"snaps up" cards that it overlaps).
	</p>
	
	<h3>Private hands</h3>

	<p>Depending on how the game is set up, there may be a private hand
		area at the bottom of the screen (separated from the playing area by a
		horizonal line). You can drag cards into and out of this area. A card
		will "snap into" the private area if more than half its height falls
		within that area or will "snap out" (back into the public area) if
		less than half its height is there. Cards in the private area are not
		visible to other players. Bear in mind that cards do not turn over
		automatically when snapping in or out of the private area (if they are
		face up they remain face up). Often you will want to drag a card into
		the private area while it is face down and only turn it over once it
		is in the private area.</p>

	<p>
		Dealing produces boxes of face down cards rather than immediately populating
		the private area. In some games (e.g. War) players play from piles
		(boxes) of cards and not from hands per se. The <b>Take Hand</b>
		action in the box action dialog will transfer an entire box of cards
		to the private area while fanning them out and turning them over. This
		is typically done by each player in turn after a deal.
	</p>

	<br>
	<hr>
	<h2>
		<a name="Setup">Setting up a Game</a>
	</h2>
    <img alt="initial game setup" src="./gameSetupDialogInitial.png">

	<p>
		As discussed previously, exactly one player will have the role of
		leader. That player will have a <b>Setup Game</b> button. Touching
		this button brings up a dialog, as shown. The actions in the dialog
		may be only part of what it means to set up the game. Other chores
		might consist of making additional boxes and arranging both cards and
		boxes in the appropriate configuration for the game.
	</p>

	<p>
		Setting up a game may be done either before connecting the players or
		afterwards, but, in either case, the setup phase is considered to be
		part of the leader's first turn to play (the leader always plays
		first). When the leader finishes setting up, the leader can yield to
		the next player (who then has the first real move in the game) or the
		leader may take that first move and then yield. Once the leader's
		first turn ends, the <b>Setup Game</b> button is no longer displayed.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Deck Type</b> decides the repertoire of cards that will be part
		of the game. The <b>Standard</b> deck consists of the 52 cards, ace
		through king, of suites spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs, with no
		jokers. In general, the playing deck can have any subset of these
		cards and up to two jokers. The repertoire can then be multiplied,
		duplicating each card the desired number of times.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In practice, the capability to design an arbitrary deck is not
		exposed to users, so you have to select from a set of named decks,
		which you can do by first touching the current selection to bring up
		the complete list, then touching the desired selection.
		<dl>
		<dt>WithJokers</dt><dd>adds two jokers to the standard deck</dd>
		<dt>Double</dt><dd>has two of each card in the standard deck</dd>
		<dt>DoubleWithJokers</dt><dd>has two of each card in the <b>WithJokers</b> deck</dd>
		<dt>Piquet</dt><dd>omits the face cards two through six from the standard deck, leaving 32
		cards, as in the game of Piquet</dd>
		<dt>Euchre</dt><dd>omits the face cards two through eight from the standard deck, leaving 24
		cards, as in the game of Euchre</dd>
		<dt>Bezique</dt><dd>the <b>Piquet</b> deck with two of each card (64 cards, as in the game of
		Bezique)</dd>
		<dt>Pinochle</dt><dd>the <b>Euchre</b> deck with two of each card (48 cards, as in the game of
		Pinochle)</dd>
		</dl>
		In the future, we will add more deck types, and will likely add the ability to
		design your own decks, but the details are not decided yet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <b>Private Hand Area</b> control determines whether there is an area reserved at the
		bottom of the screen that is private to each player and not shared.  Touch the current
		setting to toggle between <b>Present</b> and <b>Absent</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Deal</b> action opens the dealing dialog on the one box on the
		screen that has the name "Deck" (this box is always present in a new game
		that has not yet been set up). It allows you to create new deck boxes
		containing the "hands" for the game.  These may be left as boxes or converted
		into actual hands (in the private hand area) by each player on his first turn.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Save As</b> action permits you to save the current game setup
		for later use, assigning it a name to remember it by. Note that the
		entire state of the screen is saved, not just the attributes
		controlled by this dialog. So, a common practice is to first use the
		dialog to establish the deck type and private hand setting and to deal
		the cards. Then, exit the dialog and perform other actions (like
		creating discard boxes and positioning things on the screen). Then
		return to the setup dialog and save the setup.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>Use Saved Setup</b> action brings up a list of saved setups which you can
		select by name.  The saved setup will replace current game state.  This dialog
		also allows you delete saved setups by sliding entries to the left to reveal a delete
		button (a common iOS interaction paradigm).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is useful to understand what is and isn't saved and restored when you use this capability.
		The exact card denominations are <em>not</em> restored as such (otherwise you would be playing
		the identical shuffle and deal over and over again).  Rather, the positions of all the cards and boxes,
		the properties of the boxes, and which cards are face up or face down are restored, but then the
		actual cards are re-shuffled within this framework so that you are always playing with a fresh
		shuffle and deal.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <b>Reset</b> action restores the playing area to its state prior to dealing or moving any 
		cards.  This is useful if you make a hard-to-undo mistake while setting up a game.

	</h2>

    <img alt="leader's first turn" src="./firstTurn.png">
    <img alt="another player's turn" src="./secondTurn.png">

	<p>Once the players have found each other, the top area of the
		leader's screen will look like the first picture and other players
		will have a top area that looks more like the second picture.</p>

	<p>
		The top row of boxes list the players of the game, in the same order
		on every player's screen. The leader is always listed first. The
		player whose turn it is colored green. On each player's device, the

		The screen belonging to the player called Joshie has Joshie

	</p>

	<p>
		All players have an <b>End Game</b> button, which they can touch at
		any time. Any player can end the game pre-emptively at any time by
		pressing this button. Terminating the app or suspending it will also
		end the game for everyone.
	</p>

	<p>
		The player whose turn it is (but not other players) will have a <b>Yield</b>
		button. This button ends the player's turn and passes the right to
		play on to the next player in the rotation.
	</p>

	<p>Only the player whose turn it is may move or modify the cards
		and boxes on the playing screen. There is an exception for cards in
		your private hand. These may be moved or turned over at any time as
		long as they stay within the private hand area. You will only be able
		to move cards into or out of the this area when it is your turn.</p>

	<p>
		Note that the leader's screen shows the <b>Setup Game</b> button. This
		will continue to show until the leader touches <b>Yield</b> for the
		first time, ending his very first turn. Recall that the chore of
		setting up the game belongs to the leader and must be completed by the
		end of his first turn.
	</p>
	
	<p>Beyond the enforcement of "whose turn is it", and the limitations imposed by box access
	styles and box ownership, there are no real rules.  The AnyCards app does not know what card
	game is being played.</p>
