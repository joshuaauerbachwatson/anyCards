		<a name="What">What is AnyCards?</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		<em>AnyCards</em> provides a virtual table-top that is shared across
		devices. It also provides a virtual deck of cards which can be of a
		number of different sizes (but always made up of standard cards
		with or without jokers). It allows you to move and turn over cards,
        make boxes to hold stacks of cards, and do routine moves like dealing or
        taking up a hand.
	</p>

	<p>The players use their separate devices to play a card game with
		the cards. Each player may optionally have a private hand. The game
		provides for an orderly succession of turns but does not otherwise
		build in the rules of any particular card game. It will support the
		playing of a wide variety of games that are played entirely with
		cards.</p>

	<p>Achieving agreement about what game to play, enforcing its
		rules, or incorporating interactions such as bidding, may require
		voice or message contact between players (not provided by the game).</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Assembling" />How to Connect Players
	</h2>

    <p>
        AnyCards does not provide any "social" features.  Rather, players need to arrange
        in advance to play together.
        These instructions assume you have already identified the players who will play together
        and now want to connect them to each other.  Each such player must have installed AnyCards
        on a device.

	<p>
		After installing and starting the game, touch the <b>Players</b>
		button to bring up a dialog that looks like the picture. <img
			alt="initial players dialog" src="./playerDialogInitial.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		The first time you do this, <b>Your User Name</b> will be whatever
		name you gave to your device (usually not too meaningful to others).
		Touch the white text box to bring up the keyboard and replace the name
		with a name that you want to be known by when playing. Players who
		will play together should choose distinct names.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Exactly one player in the group of players must be the leader.  That player will actually set up the
		game (deal out the cards, do whatever else is required).  The leader also sets the number of players
		that are expected. Touch the blue text to the right of the <b>Are you leader?</b> label to
		toggle back and forth between being the leader and not.  Notice that the <b>Number of players</b>
		stepper appears and disappears accordingly, as does the <b>Game Setup</b> button at the top of
		the app window (not shown in the picture).
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		Decide who in your group will be the leader.  That player should select <b>Yes</b> and the others should select <b>No</b>.
        The player who is leader should then set the number of players.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		There are two ways for players to connect to each other (the <b>Player source</b>), called <b>Nearby
			only</b> and <b>Entire internet</b>. One of these modes is shown in blue.
		Touching the blue text toggles between the two modes.  All players must select the same mode.
	</p>

	<h3>Nearby Only Mode</h3>

	<p>
		In the <b>Nearby only</b> mode, players must be near each other
		(within bluetooth range or on the same wifi hub). All such players are
		assumed to be playing with each other. Once all players have set the <b>Nearby
		only</b> mode, and a single player has assumed the leader role and set the number
		of players, all players may then touch the <b>Find Players</b> button to move on
		to actual play.
	</p>

	<h3>Entire Internet Mode</h3>

	<p>
		When you switch to <b>Entire Internet</b> mode, the players can be
		anywhere, as long as they each have an internet connection active on
        their device. Some additional fields and buttons will appear. At least the <b>Token</b>
		field must be filled in.  Every player must fill in the same value.
		Once this is true, all players can touch <b>Find Players</b> and move on to actual play.
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li>The <em>token</em> is a value chosen by a group of players to distinguish
            if from other groups of players.  It should be hard to guess, so that no other AnyCards players can
            crash your game and groups of players don't collide with each other.</li>
		<li>The game token must be made up of letters and numbers only.  Upper and lower
		case letters are distinct (case is meaningful).</li>
		<li>The game token must be exactly 12 characters long.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, the token isn't used to protect your device or your personal data so it is
            ok to contain words that help players remember it, as long as this doesn't make it too likely to
            collide with other groups.  For example, <b>JohnAndAlice</b> would be a poor choice of token but
            <b>JohnAlice657</b> is probably adequate.
        </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Nicknames</h4>
	<p>
		You will also have an opportunity to enter your own nickname for the token.  This text is
		not transmitted and other players don't have to choose the same nickname or any nickname
		at all.  This optional field is provided to aid the process of remembering and retrieving
		tokens.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Remembering and retrieving tokens</h4>
	<p>
		Since it takes some effort for a group to come up with a token and for all players to enter it,
		AnyCards provides the ability to remember tokens (and their associated nicknames).  
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Show Next Token</b> button cycles through the remembered tokens.  The cycle includes an
            entry area for a new token.</li>
        <ul><li>if you have remembered tokens and want to enter a new one, you must cycle through the list until you get to
            the entry area.  It is not possible to type over the displayed remembered tokens</li></ul>
		<li>The <b>Forget this Token</b> will drop a remembered token from the list.</li>
		<li>As soon as you have entered a new valid token, the <b>Remember this Token</b> button will appear
		and give you an opportunity to add it to the list.</li>
   </ul>

        <a name="Basics">Card Manipulation Basics</a>
    </h2>
    <img alt="cards and boxes examples" src="./cardsAndBoxes.png">
    <p>
        To familiarize yourself with how to move cards and use boxes, it is helpful to go to the <b>Players</b> dialog, set yourself as leader, and set the number of players to 1 ("solitaire mode").  Then you can experiment with the features discussed here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The illustration shows examples of cards (three face up and one face down) as well as one box.  The box has been given the name "Deck" and contains 48 cards.  You can reproduce this picture as an initial exercise.  The particular card faces
            will differ from the illustration because every initial deck is shuffled randomly.  You will already have the box
            called "Deck" with 52 cards in it.  Drag four cards off the deck (non-overlapping at first).  Tap three of the cards
            to turn them over.  Then drag the three face-up cards so they overlap as in the illustration.
    </p>
    <p>Some Details follow.
    <h3>Turning cards over</h3>
    <p>
        Tapping a card that is not covered by other cards will cause it to turn over, unless the card is the top card of a deck or discard box.  For the top card of a deck box, tapping simply "dislodges" it from the box, allowing it to turned over with a second tap.  The top card of a discard box cannot be removed or turned over.
    </p>
    <h3>Bringing cards to the front</h3>
    <p>
        Tapping a card that is partly covered by other cards will bring the card to the front so that it is no longer covered.
        After that it can be tapped again to turn it over or it can be dragged by itself.  A card that is completely covered by
        other cards (so that it cannot be tapped) remains covered until the covering cards are removed.
    </p>
    <h3>Dragging cards</h3>
    <p>
        Cards may be dragged around the table-top view as part of play.  If a card is not covered by any other card, it will be
        dragged by itself.  If a card is partly covered by other cards, the cards covering the dragged card are dragged with it.
        In addition, cards that cover any other card being dragged will also be dragged.  So, in the illustration, if you drag
        the three of hearts, the seven and eight of spades will move with it.  If you drag the seven of spades, the eight will move
        with it but the three of hearts will not.  By first tapping either of the partly covered cards you change the relationship,
        of course.  So, if you first tap the three of hearts to bring it to the front, and then drag it, it will move by itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Boxes</h3>
    <p>
        Boxes hold cards.  They can be moved (their cards move with them) and have certain other helpful properties.  There are
        three kinds of boxes.
    </p>
    <p><em>Deck</em> boxes contain only face down cards.  Cards may not be added to them.  The top card cannot be turned over in
    place but it can be moved entirely or partially off the box, after which it becomes an ordinary card.  The deck box in the
    illustration happens to have the name "Deck", too, but, in general, a box's name is distinct from its kind.  The main playing
    deck of a game is called "Deck" by default.</p>
    <p><em>Discard</em> boxes

		<a name="Setup">Setting up a Game</a>
	</h2>
    <img alt="initial game setup" src="./gameSetupDialogInitial.png">
    <p>
        As discussed previously, exactly one player will have the role of leader.  That player will have a <b>Setup Game</b>
        button.  This button may be used either before connecting the players or afterwards, but, in either case, it is considered
        to be part of the leader's first turn to play (the leader always plays first).  When the leader finishes setting up,
        the leader can yield to the next player (who then has the first real move in the game) or the leader may take that first
        move and then yield.  Once the leader's first turn ends, the <b>Setup Game</b> button is no longer displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are in the role of leader, touch <b>Setup Game</b>.  You should see something like what is shown in the
        illustration.

	<h2>
		<a name="Problems" />Reporting Problems
	</h2>
	<p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.
		Touching it will bring up an initialized email sending view with the
		recipient set to the AnyCards reporting address and some instructions
		in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with
		your specific problem report).</p>
	<p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or
		input that you like, but a key purpose is to support reporting bugs
		and other problems that you are having with the app. To this end, the
		email, by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent
		activity. When you are reporting a serious problem, such as a crash or
		misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
		place since they help in diagnosing problems. They include only
		information about recent sequences of actions inside the app itself
		and do not include any personal information. However, if you feel more
		comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
