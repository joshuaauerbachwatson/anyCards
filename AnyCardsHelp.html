		<a name="What">What is AnyCards?</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		<em>AnyCards</em> provides a virtual table-top that is shared across
		devices. It also provides a virtual deck of cards which can be of a
		number of different sizes (but always made up of standard cards
		without jokers). It allows you to make boxes to hold stacks of cards.
	</p>

	<p>The players use their separate devices to play a card game with
		the cards. Each player may optionally have a private hand. The game
		provides for an orderly succession of turns but does not otherwise
		build in the rules of any particular card game. It will support the
		playing of a wide variety of games that are played entirely with
		cards.</p>

	<p>Achieving agreement about what game to play, enforcing its
		rules, or incorporating interactions such as bidding, may require
		voice or message contact between players (not provided by the game).</p>

		<a name="Assembling" />How to Assemble Players
	</h2>

	<p>
		After installing and starting the game, touch the <b>Players</b>
		button to bring up a dialog that looks like the picture. <img
			alt="pictureOfPlayersDialog" src="playerDialog1.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		The first time you do this, <b>Your User Name</b> will be whatever
		name you gave to your device (usually not too meaningful to others).
		Touch the white text box to bring up the keyboard and replace the name
		with a name that you want to be known by when playing. A group of
		players that wants to play together should be sure to choose
		distinctive names.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Exactly one player in the group of players must be the leader.  That player will actually set up the
		game (deal out the cards, do whatever else is required).  The leader also sets the number of players
		that are expected. Touch the blue text to the right of the <b>Are you leader?</b> label to
		toggle back and forth between being the leader and not.  Notice that the <b>Number of players</b>
		stepper appears and disappears accordingly, as does the <b>Game Setup</b> button at the top of
		the app window (not shown in the picture).
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		Decide who in your group will be the leader and let that player set the number of players.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		There are two ways for players to find each other (the <b>Player source</b>), called <b>Nearby
			only</b> and <b>Entire internet</b>. One of these modes is shown in blue.
		Touching the blue text toggles between the two modes.  All players must select the same mode.
	</p>

	<h3>Nearby Only Mode</h3>

	<p>
		In the <b>Nearby only</b> mode, players must be near each other
		(within bluetooth range or on the same wifi hub). All such players are
		assumed to be playing with each other. Once all players have set the <b>Nearby
		only</b> mode, a single player has assumed the leader role and set the number
		of players, all players can touch the <b>Find Players</b> button to move on
		to the game setup phase.
	</p>

	<h3>Entire Internet Mode</h3>

	<p>
		When you switch to <b>Entire Internet</b> mode, the players can be
		anywhere, as long as they each have an internet connection. Some
		additional fields and buttons will appear. At least the <b>Token</b>
		field must be filled in.  Every player must fill in the same value.
		Once this is true, all players can touch <b>Find Players</b> and move on to the
		game setup phase.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <em>game token</em> is a value chosen by a group of players to distinguish
		if from other groups of players.  It is useful if it is meaningful to the group
		but more important that it be hard to guess, so that no other AnyCards players can
		crash your game and groups of players don't collide with each other.</li>
		<li>The game token must be made up of letters and numbers only.  Upper and lower
		case letters are distinct (case is meaningful).</li>
		<li>The game token must be exactly 12 characters long.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Nicknames</h4>
	<p>
		You will also have an opportunity to enter your own nickname for the token.  This text is
		not transmitted and other players don't have to choose the same nickname or any nickname
		at all.  This optional field is provided to aid the process of remembering and retrieving
		tokens.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Remembering and retrieving tokens</h4>
	<p>
		Since it takes some effort for a group to come up with a token and for all players to enter it,
		AnyCards provides the ability to remember tokens (and their associated nicknames).  
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Show Next Token</b> button cycles through the remembered tokens.  If a remembered token is
		showing, you can also use this button to bring up the entry area for a new token.</li>  
		<li>The <b>Forget this Token</b> will drop a remembered token from the list.</li>
		<li>As soon as you have entered a new valid token, the <b>Remember this Token</b> button will appear
		and give you an opportunity to add it to the list.</li>
   </ul>

		<a name="Problems" />Reporting Problems
	</h2>
	<p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.
		Touching it will bring up an initialized email sending view with the
		recipient set to the AnyCards reporting address and some instructions
		in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with
		your specific problem report).</p>
	<p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or
		input that you like, but a key purpose is to support reporting bugs
		and other problems that you are having with the app. To this end, the
		email, by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent
		activity. When you are reporting a serious problem, such as a crash or
		misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
		place since they help in diagnosing problems. They include only
		information about recent sequences of actions inside the app itself
		and do not include any personal information. However, if you feel more
		comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
