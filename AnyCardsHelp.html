<br><hr><h2><a name="What"/>What is <em>AnyCards</em>?</h2>

 <p><em>AnyCards</em> provides a shared playing surface across devices and supplies a virtual deck of cards.
	By default, this is a standard 52 card deck but alternative decks can be selected by the initiating
	player.</p>

 <p>The players use their separate devices to play a card game with the cards.  Each player may optionally
	have a private hand.  The game provides for an orderly succession of turns but does not otherwise build in
	the rules of any particular card game.  It will support the playing of a wide variety of games (those that
	don't require non-card accessories such as chips).</p>

 <p>Achieving agreement about what game to play, enforcing its rules, or incorporating interactions such as
	bidding, may require voice or message contact between players (not provided by the game).</p>

<br><hr><h2><a name="Controls"/>The Game Controls</h2>
			
 <p>At the top of the game screen you will see the following controls.</p>
   <img src="buttonsScreenshot.png" width="500">

<h3>Player Labels</h3>

 <p>The four white labels in the top row list the players of the game.  AnyCards may be played with any number of
	 players between one (solitaire) and four.

 <p>Before the list of players has been assembled, the first label will contain your own name.  If you have
	 not yet established a name for yourself in the game settings, this name will be the name of your device.
	 The fact that it represents you is indicated by the asterisks and italics.  To set a meaningful name for
	 yourself, touch <tt>Game</tt>, and fill in "Your User Name."</p>

 <p>Depending on how you have set the minimum and maximum number of players, remaining player labels are set
   to <tt>[Must Find]</tt> (needed to meet the minimum) or <tt>[Optional]</tt> (above the minimum, below the
   maximum).  If the maximum number of players is less than four, the excess labels are omitted.</p>

 <p>After the list of players has been assembled (see <a href="#Players">Assembling Players</a>), each
   player's chosen name (or device name is displayed).  Your own name will appear (in italics with asterisks)
   but not necessarily first.  The list represents the order of play, and the player in the first position
   must play first.  The player whose turn is current is indicated by a green color.  The number of players will be
   fixed for the remainder of the game.</p>

<h3>Help Button</h3>

 <p>You probably know already that this button brings up this help text.</p>
																																											
<h3>Groups Button</h3>

 <p>This button opens a dialog that allows you to manage groups of players that can play games together without
	 being "nearby."  See <a href="#Groups">Managing Groups</a>.</p>

<h3>Group Name Label</h3>
 
 <p>This label states the name of the group with which you are currently playing.  The special "nearby only"
	 group consists of other players who are close by, are running AnyCards, and have agreed to let AnyCards use
	 the local wifi to communicate.  Other groups can contain remote players but must be created and joined as
	 described in <a href="#Groups">Managing Groups</a>.</p>

<br><hr><h2><a name="Problems"/>Reporting Problems</h2>
 <p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.  Touching it will bring up an
	 initialized email sending view with the recipient set to the AnyCards reporting address and some
	 instructions in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with your specific problem
	 report).</p>
 <p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or input that you like, but a key purpose is
   to support reporting bugs and other problems that you are having with the app.  To this end, the email,
	 by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent activity.  When you are reporting a
	 serious problem, such as a crash or misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
	 place since they help in diagnosing problems.  They include only information about recent sequences of
	 actions inside the app itself and do not include any personal information.  However, if you feel more
	 comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
