	<br><hr><h2><a name="What"/>What is <em>AnyCards</em>?</h2>

			<p><em>AnyCards</em> provides a shared playing surface across devices and supplies deck of cards.  By
			default, this is a standard 52 card deck but alternative decks can be selected by the initiating player.
			The players use their separate devices to play a card game with the cards.  Each player may optionally
			have a private hand.  The game provides for an orderly succession of turns but does not otherwise build
			in the rules of any particular card game.  It will support the playing of a wide variety of games (those
			that don't require non-card accessories such as chips).  Achieving agreement about what game to play,
			enforcing its rules, or incorporating vocal phases such as bidding, may require voice or message contact
			between players (not provided by the game).

	<br><hr><h2><a name="Controls">The Game Controls</h2>
   <p>At the top of the game screen you will see the following controls.				
     <img src="buttonsScreenshot.png" width="500">
  <h3>Player Labels</h3>

	 <p>The four white labels in the top row list the players of the game.
     <ul><li>AnyCards can be played with more than four players but we are currently only making provision for showing up to four players explicitly.</li></ul>
	 <p>Before the list of players has been assembled, the first label will contain your own name.  If you have
		 not yet established a name for yourself in the game settings, this name will be the name of your device.
		 The fact that it represents you is indicated by the asterisks and italics.

	<br><hr><h2><a name="Problems"/>Reporting Problems</h2>
		<p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.  Touching it will bring up an
			initialized email sending view with the recipient set to the AnyCards reporting address and some
			instructions in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with your specific problem
			report).
		<p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or input that you like, but a key purpose is
			to support reporting bugs and other problems that you are having with the app.  To this end, the email,
			by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent activity.  When you are reporting a
			serious problem, such as a crash or misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
			place since they help in diagnosing problems.  They include only information about recent sequences of
			actions inside the app itself and do not include any personal information.  However, if you feel more
			comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.
